    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression:\n",
    "    1. Real world application - General classification where you can draw a line (plane) through and split up your data.  Possible classifier for people with diabetes where the features could be their age, weight, BMI score, and amount of exercise.  The output could be weather they already have or do not have diabetes.\n",
    "    2. Strengths of the model - Quick and works well if the number of features is less than the number of training samples.\n",
    "    3. Weakness of the model - Only fits linear data unless you go back and add polynomial terms into your data.  Logistic regression is not a large margin classifier, so it might not come up with as good of a fit as SVM.\n",
    "    4. What makes this a good candidate for the problem - The number of features for this data is smaller than the number of training examples.  Some of the data looks like it could be divided up linearly (capital gains seems to have very high and very low values).<br>[https://machinelearning-blog.com/2018/04/23/logistic-regression-101/](https://machinelearning-blog.com/2018/04/23/logistic-regression-101/)<br>[https://towardsdatascience.com/support-vector-machine-vs-logistic-regression-94cc2975433f](https://towardsdatascience.com/support-vector-machine-vs-logistic-regression-94cc2975433f)\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. Decision Tree:\n",
    "    1. Real world application - Classifying people into groups where the data might not be linear.  If a feature (like age) was broken into three groups, the high and low ages might be significantly different than the middle group.  This could be used for identifying people to market to based on their ability to pay.\n",
    "    2. Strengths of the model - Decision trees don't try and seperate the data with a single line or plane like linear regression, so it has more \"freedom\" to break the data into different smaller categories.\n",
    "    3. Weakness of the model - Without any optimizing, the decision tree seems to always it over fit the data.  The F score for the training data is very high (>0.95) but the score for the test data is low (lower than logistic regression)\n",
    "    4. What makes this a good candidate for the problem - The features (age, education, capital gains) all look like they might have clear places where the data would naturally break into sub groups.  People who are very young or very old might not have incomes as high as someone in the middle of their lives.  This seems like it might work to the advanatage of a tree sepearator.<br>[https://towardsdatascience.com/a-guide-to-decision-trees-for-machine-learning-and-data-science-fe2607241956](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-guide-to-decision-trees-for-machine-learning-and-data-science-fe2607241956)\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "3. Gradient Boosting:\n",
    "    1. Real world application - From what I have read, this is a boosted version of a decision tree.  I think it would have similar applications as a decision tree (good for seperating data that doesn't break along one line or plane).  Since it is \"boosted\" (taking the strengths of the experts as the instructor had mentioned), it might do a better job than just a plain decision tree.\n",
    "    2. Strengths of the model - I suspect that it will have similar strengths as decision trees with the benefit of leveraging the experts.\n",
    "    3. Weakness of the model - Since it is more complex than the standard decision tree, this might mean that it will be harder to optimize or that it might take longer to train.  Decision trees already have a number of parameters to optimize to prevent over fitting.  I suspect that this model will have more hyperparameters that can be fine tuned.\n",
    "    4. What makes this a good candidate for the problem - For the same reason that decision trees should work, I think this might be a good model to use.\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "From the Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and Gradient Boost, Gradient Boost seems to be the winner with the highest F-score on the training data.  With that said, the plain Decision Tree has a much better score on the training data, so it is probably over fitting and might improve if the parameters were optimized (i.e. max depth was limited so that the model generalized better).  Logistic Regression did fairly well on the f-score for the test data, but it only did slightly better on the training data, which suggests that this might be as good as the logistic model can do.  One of the biggest draw backs to gradient boost is the training time, which is significantly longer than either logisitc regression or decision trees."

    "The Gradient Boost model is taking the training data and trying to find natural places to break the data so that we can predict which groups will have a high probability of making over 50k.  If we only looked at two features, for example education level and age, we might find that people with high education are more likely to make over 50k, so people that have a college or higher education level might be more likely to have higher pay.  Age is a little more interesting, since a single break might not work.  Very young people will probably not have high incomes yet.  On the other hand, older people, say past retirement, might have lower incomes, leaving people in their middle years as the people we are most interested in.  Gradient Boost will automatically seperate out these groups for us and we can validate how well the model works by training the model on a sub group of the data and then testing it on the remaining data."

    "When I plotted the data, I saw that education number was a good predictor where higher education led to higher incomes (education number above 11).  I would follow that with marital status where being married seemed to be a good indication of higher income (about 45% of married people were making over 50k) while never married was a clear negative indicator (less than 5% of people were making over 50k).  This same patterned showed up in Relationship where husband and wife labels had high income.  This seems like marital status and relaltionship are saying the same thing and there is no new data.  Next I would have placed capital gain and capital loss.  For both features, there were not that many people who had a value in the column, but when they did, they had about a 50% chance of making over 50k.  Last I would have put age.  Age showed an almost normal distribution with the most people making over 50k were about 45 years old.  People under 21 rarely made over 50k and people over 65 rarely made over 50k."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
